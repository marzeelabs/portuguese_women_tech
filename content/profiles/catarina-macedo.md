**Early years and where you came from?**

I have been passionate about gaming for as long as I remember and games were exactly what sparked my interest in technology. So besides playing them, I wanted to learn more about how they are made and how I could be part of it. Alongside competing in eSports when it wasn't even a word, I chose Software Engineering in Universidade do Minho when it came the time to decide what I would focus my studies on. I also pursued the Computer Graphics major during my Master's in Universidade do Minho and later moved to Instituto Superior Técnico to focus on Game Development, which is a major they offer.

**How were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

I got my first internship when I had just finished my Bachelor's in Software Engineer and wanted to get some real world, hands on experience. That was in DevScope in Oporto as a developer and it was the absolute best experience as a first job as one can hope for. People there were amazing, super talented and had loads of patience to deal with me and my learning. I then left so I could properly finished my Masters but still miss the company to this day. While I was doing my Master Thesis, and through being part of the Microsoft Student Partner program, I got an offer to be an intern in Microsoft Portugal, to manage the same MSP program. It was such an awesome experience that I never left Microsoft again! After the internship I joined the MACH (Microsoft Academy for College Hires) program as a Support Engineer in Windows Core and High Availability, and have recently moved to Redmond (Microsoft HQ), USA as a Technical Evangelist for US Gaming partners!

**Walk me through your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

Right now I am a Technical Evangelist for US Gaming partners, working at Microsoft HQ, in Redmond. Our work here is as exciting as it gets as our day to day job is literally doing all-day hackathons with our customers and partners to help them adopt our new technologies and solve their problems. I have been lately learning a lot around CaaP (Conversation as a Platform) and contributing to an Open Source Framework so that game developers can quickly deploy their games and services on Azure. Other than that, I am helping in Women in Technology initiatives internally as well as keeping my passion for gaming and eSports alive by helping to run Xbox League, a series of online tournaments in Portugal, every month (casting matches is harder than it looks...).

**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

The thing I love the most is being able to be around customers and partners most of my time, having the opportunity to always work with the latest technologies, as well as attending conferences and being a part of the gaming industry. The fact that the impact we have after the hackathons we do is so visible is something that gives me a motivation boost every day!

**How do you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the Portuguese tech industry?**

I have left the Portuguese tech industry since I moved to the US, but while I was there I definitely felt that the amount of experience I previously had with gaming and game development as well as knowing a lot of the pioneers of this industry in Portugal had a super positive impact in my work. We were able to work together to build great things, and I do like to approach my work as I approach my game time: I don't give up; and if there is something I don't know, I will definitely play with it and seek help from peers until I understand it and can work with it.

**What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

The most important thing is to not give up on your passion! If you feel strongly passionate about something, people will see it right when they look at you and see you talking about it (aka sparkling eyes). You have a lot of free resources online that can help you kickstart your learning. Set a very realistic goal for yourself with a very realistic timeline, invest time in it, and you will be surprised at how much you can achieve! Attend events and get inspired by the great people who are already doing the work you want to do in the future.

**Walk me through a day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**

I wake up super early so I can attend the meetings with my European team (as I am 8 hours behind GMT timezone), I have a big breakfast, feed my cat Noob, which is the highlight of my morning as I am not a morning person whatsoever (not ashamed!) and I drive to the office. Sometimes I work from home. Then it's a matter of coding and contributing to whichever project I am working on, helping my peers with their own events to any extent I can, and inbox keeping. I leave the end of the day for my personal projects or stretch assignments that I volunteer myself to do. I do have my share of travel in this role, so planes are now a common workplace for me as well. Once I am done with work, I go to the gym for an hour, have some dinner and turn on my Xbox to play Gears of War for a few hours... and then Netflix my way to sleep (not a very healthy practice I've heard!)

**What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?**

"Say yes until you can't say no."

–

**What apps/software/tools can’t you live without?**

Visual Studio Code is my best buddy nowadays, and OneNote is my life (I am a very forgetful person who needs to keep track of everything). Whats App has been my connecting app to friends and family I left in Portugal when I moved to the US.

If games can be considered, Gears of War has been my loyal partner in life.

My awesome team has been developing a great project to make game services very easy to deploy in Azure, all open source! Go take a look: [https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/nether](https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/nether)
