**Early years and where you came from?**

Studied in Lisbon and then left to (work, study or live) in Paris, London, Shanghai, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, San Francisco.

Tried to do my first company in China and the second (in tech) in Brazil.

Came back to Portugal in 2014 and left again in 2017 to
London, where I currently work in a 
Portuguese/English venture builder where we create and invest in
startups.

**How were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

When I was back in Lisbon in 2014, Beta-i events and all the others I found in Meet Up were really useful.

**Walk me through your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I have a dual role:
Investment Role: Analyse investments in startups that combine collective with artificial intelligence.
Operational Role: Look at sectors were we plan to create our own ventures and develop a business plan to help achieve it.
This includes some financial modelling, studying partnerships and recruiting

**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

I really like the investor perspective.

**How do you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the Portuguese tech industry?**

Portugal forced many of us to be global. That is a great thing in the world we are living today.

**What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Keep looking. Try different things.   
If you don't have a great idea, it's ok.
Start or participate in a small initiative/project - you to get to know yourself better, what you like, what you are driven to,  and where you can make the best difference - for the company/project, but most importantly - in your life :)

**What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?**

It's a cliché but really helpful when trying to breach barriers and aim higher: "Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars."
