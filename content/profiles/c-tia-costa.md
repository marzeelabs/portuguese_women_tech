**How were you introduced
to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

When I was 13 years old, my father gave me my first computer I had to take a short course of Microsoft Office. In this time I fell in love with technology and computers.

**What part of what you do,
you love the most?**

Of all the work what I love the most is the social part of the business. We work to help charities and people in need. It shows a new approach where it’s possible to have a business and create social impact at the same time.

**How do you think that your
background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

I was lucky that the Marketing course I studied gave me also some knowledge in management, consumer’s laws, and other subjects besides marketing. This facilitate my thinking about products/services and how it develops as companies.

**What advice do you have
for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

My advice is to start anyway, the most important step is to start! Start talking with people in the area, go to tech events, ask opinions/feedback and make a brainstorming ideas with colleagues…

Don’t hear who says we (women) have less probability of success or can’t do it.

**Walk me through a day in
your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**
