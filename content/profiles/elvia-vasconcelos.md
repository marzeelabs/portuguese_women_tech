**Early years and where you
came from?**

I studied Fashion Design in Lisbon and came to London to do a Masters in Digital Arts and never left.

—

**How were you introduced
to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

I work in London but i am keen to become part of the digital world in Portugal.

—

**Walk me through your work
and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I am currently working at SapientRazorfish_ a digital agency delivering business transformation across several Industries. Most recently, I have been focusing on emerging technology, in particular Artificial Intelligence and how we can adapt to design these future experiences.

—

**What part of what you do,
you love the most?**

The thought that what I do has an impact in the world. We design the things that people use everyday.

—

**How do you think that your
background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

I would like to bring my experience and knowledge to the Portuguese tech industry, in particular the things I have learned from the many Design communities organized via meetups, eventbrites etc and the skills I have developed in the visual thinking area as a sketchnoter. On the feminist front, I would like to raise awareness and promote organization and mentorship.

**What advice do you have
for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Speak to people about it. Do the hard work to figure out what you want before you meet them, but trust that you will eventually find your fit. Go to events. Go for coffees. Speak to the professionals you admire, figure out where they are going and go there too!

**Walk me through a day in
your life as a Portuguese woman in tech.**

I'll describe a day of this week: A day in the life of a London based Portuguese woman in tech might start with a breakfast talk at a nearby agency, on the Rise of AI. Feeling pleasantly surprised that the conversation was about the sociological and political implications of AI rather than 'Can we deliver it' I will head to the office and work on a project. Normally part of a small team, I'll be engaging with developers, designers, account directors and the client to bring a product to life. Sometimes this means doing user research, other times it might be bringing to life requirements by sketching a user journey on the wall. In the evening, I might attend an User Experience Professional Association event, where I will be sketchnoting. Cycle home. Rinse. Repeat.

—

**What's the best advice
you've ever received?**

Be bold. Make a statement.

**What apps/software/tools
