**Early years and where you came from?**

I’ve been working for the Lisbon’s Municipality since
1996, mostly in the press office, cultural affairs and internal communications,
and now I’m assigned at Startup Lisboa, since 2013. Before that I’ve worked as
a journalist in a radio and in a magazine while I was getting my BA in
Communication. I usually say that “Faço cultura por fora”, so I have always
worked in other things besides the City Hall, in cinema, as a copy writer, as
host and PR in a weekly cultural event, as an editor, as a ghost writer for my
friends.

**How
were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

When I was invited to join Startup Lisboa’s team, four
years ago. I didn’t even knew what a startup was. It’s been a great journey. I
like challenges and to decode things I don’t understand.

**Walk me
through your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

As Head of Communications, my job is to provide the
best image of Startup Lisboa inside and out the incubator, by enhancing the
public awareness of the startups we support. My goal is helping entrepreneurs
to shine through the brand Startup Lisboa, and create a good internal
environment by providing useful information, tools and content to the
development of their businesses. Nevertheless, since I work in a very small
team, we all do a little bit of everything. In this world you can not reduced
yourself to a job's title, and sometimes it’s hard to focus on your tasks. Most
of the times I say that I do what is urgent and I delay what sometimes it's
important. To summarize: I'm a natural born PR: It fits in almost everything I
do.  Recently I’ve started to develop Startup Lisboa’s merchandising
project and I’m thrill with the project and its potential to our brand and to
the sense of community. A lot of work ahead!

**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

Getting the chance to know all sort of people and
connecting them. Either you’re coding, selling, designing, painting, filming...
it’s all about people. You can have the best code or the best business model,
but at the end it’s all about the people behind it. I love people. And I have
met great people at Startup Lisboa. I feel happy whenever they get success, I
feel sad when they fail, like it was my own successes and failures.

**How do
you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your
work in the Portuguese tech industry?**

When your background is social sciences and cultural
affairs you probably have a more flexible way to approach life. You don’t get
stuck in concepts and rules. You are used to people pursuing their dreams and
doing a lot of uncommon things to achieve them. You’re free to analyze and
decode things and people with a wider vision. You tend to think about solutions
instead of problems. You’re used to see the world upside down. You’re a dreamer
without a business plan. So you can add some dream to the business, and learn
about business to add it to your dream. I’m still working on that.

**What advice do you have for young women that want to
get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Talk with women and men that are already doing stuff,
go to events and pre-accelerators programs, get engaged in the community,
reading a lot about tech businesses, search for the best practices and stories
on internet, discover what you want to copy and what you hate and never would
do. But most of all find your passion and purpose, what do you want to be.
Don’t think about money, think about your passion. When you’re moved by passion
everything will sorted out just fine and money will come; Seems easy, but
actually finding out what you actually want is one of the most difficult things
to do in life. Last but not least: find the best people to join you in the
ride. The team is the key to success. And also: It’s never too late to
\(re)start. (I keep saying this to myself…).

**Walk me
through a day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**

I am not a morning person, so I start working very
slowly when I’m connecting my iPhone between 8 and [9 am](http://airmail.calendar/2016-05-09%2009:00:00%20WEST), checking e-mails and social media, and I
finish the work day when I turn off the iPhone, most of the times after
midnight. In the middle, I mix businesses with pleasures. Always.

**What's the best advice you've ever received?**

Better done than perfect.

**What apps/software/tools can't you live without?**

All the apps/software by the startups members of
Startup Lisboa, of course! In particular, I’m using in a daily base two
platforms: Outplanr, to organize our teamwork, and Facestore for our
merchandise. Squarespace, Mailchimp, Google tools, Facebook, Instagram and
Twitter are indispensable work tools, and I'm starting to use Workplace. I use
Citymaper almost everydays (I've a terrible sense of orientation) and I’m
addicted to shopping online meaning my iphone is full of retail mobile apps.
