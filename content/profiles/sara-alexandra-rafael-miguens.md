**Early years and where you came from?**

I was born in Lisbon and I have always lived here.

I  lived with my grandparents, in the city center, until I went to school.

I have always loved to communicate with people, so it was a easy to understand that my professional career would be related with communication.

–

**How were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

I started  an internship at EDP's IT Department, in the Internal Communcations, Change Management and Events Area by 2012, that's how I was introduced to the world of portuguese tech.

–

**Walk me through your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I work as a support of the IT Department, in matters of communications, change management, events.

–

**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

My favourite part is related with events management and working through internal communcations as a way to garantee that our resources are engaged, as a essential part in every processes of change management.

–

**How do you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the Portuguese tech industry?**

My degree was really useful not only to develop an holistic perspective on organizations and communications, but also to help me working some skills related with adaptation, research, self study. That was really important for me to approach tech industry, where I work, because I had no specific academic background in tech but I work with tech communications, so I need to understand the themes, have curiosity, never stop researching and learning.

–

**What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Be adaptive. Devolop not only your knowledge but also your soft skills. Those days, where everyone knows so much about so many things, and when everyone has high formation, the most important thing to differentiate yourself, especially into tech, are your soft skills, that include communications, ease in interpersonal relationships, team working.

–

**Walk me through a day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**

Tipically I collect the relevant events that have interest on a perspective on communication, make follw ups of tech projects to keep on tracking on the relevant facts to communicate, manage some events related with tech themes.

–

**What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?**

It was a metaphor related with the chinese circus. A director with whom I've worked before started at EDP once told me that there's a number very appreciated at chinese circus, where the artists roll some plates. And the plates keep getting more and more, and the purpose is to always keep the plates rolling without anyone falling. Sometimes we need to roll some with more velocity, and others with less. And that was an advice that I always remember at my professional life: "Keep the all the plates rolling".
