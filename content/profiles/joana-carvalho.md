**Early years and where you came from?**

I studied in the Minho University where I enrolled in Software Engineering. But, before finishing the degree I started working at a company called CSide that works with Home Automation and all that that entails. Then I went to Farfetch where I was a part of a Fast Track team and a Performance and Scalability Team. Then I went to Mindera where I worked where I worked as a Software Engineer but in a very special environment. And now I live in Dublin where I work as Performance Engineer in a Performance and Scalability team.

**How were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

I saw some posts on Facebook and through some communities.

**Walk me through your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I sometimes say I test for the zombie apocalypse. I test the software for resilience and load, making sure all the system behaves properly and that it scales. I check if the system can withstand the new developments and if they are within the expected performance budget or if we need to add more machines or do improvements to maintain the systems resilience.

**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

I love to be able to catch that rogue process that is making everyones life miserable and it's causing the memory to full gc itself over and over.

**How do you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the Portuguese tech industry?**

Even though I'm not working in Portugal anymore I think all our experiences, being in tech or not influence the way we work and relate to others. And we often see ourselves portrait has being anti social, basement living people that don't interact with each other, but the secret to good resilient software is communication. That's what I've learned.

**What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

I would say that they have to go with an open mind, and that they have to be open to change and to learning more and investigating more every day. I think that the best way to start is by finding something that thrills you and just go for it.
