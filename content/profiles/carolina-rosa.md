**Early years and where you came from?**

From an early age I knew I would like do some king of designer work. That is why, when it was time, I choose to take a bachelor degree in Communication Design in the faculty of Fine Arts, in Lisbon.
As the years went by I started to get interested in Webdesign and User experience, which lead me to take a master's degree in Multimedia Design at the University of Coimbra.
After that I started to work as a Digital Designer.

**How were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

I believe I'm still being introduced to the Portuguese tech industry. I've read some things, went to some meetups and met some people, but there is so much more about this world I'm still getting to know.

**What part of what you do, you love the most?
**

I love to think about the user experience. It is amazing how much we can improve someone else's experience by think about it in advance. Non-frustrated users are my goal :)

**What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?
**

Start by studying something you like, then take the chances you get, talk to people, go to meetings, read..  
Don't be afraid to look nerdy nor to be the only woman among a huge male crowd, trust that you are where you were meant to be and be confident.
