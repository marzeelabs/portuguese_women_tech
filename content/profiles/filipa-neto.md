**Early years and where you came from?**

I’m from Lisbon and I’m
26\. Since a young age I engaged with fashion and technology. I remember
spending days at my grandparents clothes manufacturing company or playing with
a computers at my parents retail software company.

**How were you
introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

My first tech memory was
playing with Paint. At 7 years old I started attending computer classes and
around 12 I received my first Lego robot so that I could learn how to
program.

**Walk me through
your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I’m co-founder and
managing director of Chic by Choice. We are the leading designer dress rental
platform in Europe.  I’m responsible for
the overall  strategy of the company,  product roadmap, stakeholders relations, as
well as management and recruitment of team members.

**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

What I like the most is
product. Is great to build something people like and optimize that experience
to make it easier and better everyday. It’s a combination of  analytical tasks, understanding the user and
a creative side for finding new solutions. I also appreciate the chance to meet
incredible people from tech and fashion. It’s great to have access to learning
with the best in each industry.

--

**How do you think
that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

I studied economics at
Católica Business School. I would say coming from a background that makes you
develop your analytical side was a great influence.  Nevertheless I really believe in continuous
learning. There’s so much to learn when you are a curious person. I’m an avid
book reader. I really enjoy the learning process.

--

**What advice do you have for young women that
want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Go to meetups, read and
try to learn as much as you can. Be curious. There’s nothing you cannot learn.

--

**Walk me through a
day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**

First thing I do is a
list of things I can’t fail that day. Not more than 3 things. Then I review the
key performance indicators of the website. At 10 am we have our everyday stand
up meeting. A lot of my time is making sure that all the
different teams have a clear roadmap and that they receive all the feedback
they need as well as meeting with different stakeholders of the business.

--

**What's the best advice you've ever received?**

Listen to everyone but
follow your own instincts.

--

**What apps/software/tools can't you live
without?**

Google Analytics, Gmail,
Trello.

--

**Anything else you want to share?**

It’s not how good you are it’s how good you
want to be.
