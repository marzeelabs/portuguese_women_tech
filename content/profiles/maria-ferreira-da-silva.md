**Early years and where you came from?**

Since a young age, I always wanted to solve social problems like poverty, inequality, and waste.  I was lucky enough to grow in a family that always guided and inspired me to pursue this mission.  I studied design and worked as a filmmaker since then. Got married to Duarte, packed our bags and started traveling the world to collect and film stories about social entrepreneurs.

**How were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

It came from a necessity! Use technology for good. 

We started to build WeChangers - an online platform to connect the World Changers - and need to design and develop it from scratch. That's when the real introduction happened!
