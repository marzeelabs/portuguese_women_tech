**Early years and where you came from?**

I was born in a
really small town near Fátima, in the center of Portugal. When I say small I mean
really small: there was no one my age. Besides playing with my brother and
sister I used to read a lot. I always dreamed of going to a bigger city and
spending time with my family exploring Lisbon in the summer. I
moved to Lisbon to study Networks and Computer Engineering.

**How were you
introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

Before being introduced to the tech world I was
introduced to the engineering world. My father is really hands on and liked
electronics and mechanics a lot, so he used to explain me the internals of
cars, machines and so on. After passing that to my brother, he enrolled in a
tech course in high school and I started scanning his networking and
programming books. That got me curious and was the reason why I chose Networks
and Computer Engineering: I thought that was going to play an important role in
the future and I wanted to learn more about it. Although I didn’t know much at
that time, since my only contact with computers was basically playing some
games and changing disk drives, I really liked it!

**Walk me through
your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

Right now I am taking a sabbatical which includes
traveling, learning and spending time with family and friends.

Coming from the startup world, my day used to be full
of adrenaline. When we started Talkdesk, working on the product, speaking with
customers and iterating was really exciting. After that, came the phase where
we had to start expanding the team in other subjects like Design, Marketing,
Support and Sales. That brought a new set of challenges. The last year we had
to hire a lot of people to keep up with our growth and overall my work was
focused on that and in supporting the team.

**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

I really like to
solve problems over team work, so my favorite part is to work in a group to
solve a challenging issue.

--

**How do you think
that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

I guess that
impacts how people approach work in general. Being in the startup world, we are
surrounded by other companies with ambitious goals and good ideas so we know
moving faster is one of the most important things. On top of that I am an
engineer and my approach to everything is “let’s find the solution”. Both
combined make me a person with a “to the point” approach.

**What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and
don’t know where to start?**

Nowadays all the technical knowledge is online, so
there is no excuse not to learn. As we may find a natural resistance to learn
just for the sake of learning the best way is to find a project that works as
an excuse for us to apply the skills.

**Walk me through a
day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**

A day in my life can vary a lot so I prefer to organize my week around projects I'm working at. Typically I dedicate 3 days a week to focused work and working with no interruptions which is really important and a challenge nowadays. The remaining of the week I am more open - meetings and external interactions are allowed. Another important part of my life is learning - this can be reading or doing an online course, but is for sure part of my day.

While at Talkdesk my days would be really different
because the company changed a lot along the years. While initially they would
be more towards individual work, turned into a more collaborative environment
as I became more of an enabler once the company grew.

These would be the common tasks:

-      
Wake up as early as possible (but
never early enough), have breakfast and leave to the office.

-      
Arrive in the office early
morning, check email and do some focused work including planning, reviewing
materials, writing code, preparing presentations or interact with customers.

-      
Lunch with the team, friend or a candidate.

-      
Afternoons were typically more
dynamic with me participating in team meetings, customer calls, interviews or
working with other managers.

-      
Leave the office between 21h or
23h, eat something and work a bit more since the US was still awake and there
is always someone demanding your attention.

**Whats the best advice you’ve ever received?**

We have the power to change things but we will have to
break some rules we thought were pre-established. We will then find they were
not.

**What apps/software/tools can’t you live without?**

There are the apps and utilities we don’t even realise
we use on a daily basis: google maps, messenger apps (whatsapp, facebook
messenger, telegram, slack), skype and social networks. Besides those, here are my
favorites:

-      
Evernote: since I use it to keep
daily todo lists, take notes and organize myself.

-      
Podcasts: the perfect way of
spending commute time.

-      
Kindle: I really like to read and
when I don’t have my kindle I use the mobile app.

-      
Email is not really a favorite but
it’s useful along with Google Calendar.

-      
Plus, I google everything so in
general I keep my phone close by.
