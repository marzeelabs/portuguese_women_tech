**Early years and where you came from?**

I launched my first website in 2000: an e-commerce (wedding list) and wedding planner (a personal project that I sold to José de Mello Group).
In 2004 I launched my first mobile site: a news’ portal with also stock market information (belonging to Optimus, a mobile operator).
In 2014 I launched my first mobile app (IOS and Android): a loyalty app for continente, the leading food retailer in Portugal.  
Since then I've worked in more 13 different mobile apps and 2 websites in Sonae Group.

The beauty about digital is that you can learn a lot of things for free, attending to digital courses, trying the digital tools (invest 50 € in adwords or facebook ads and see what are the results and  what you can improve...). With the right knowledge, you can easily promote yourself in the digital world and find your dream job.
