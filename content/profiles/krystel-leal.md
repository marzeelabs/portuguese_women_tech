**Early years and where you came from?
**

I was born in France, but I moved to Lisbon when I was only four years old. With 19, I moved to Paris to studied at the Sorbonne University. In Paris, I start traveling and discover the remote work. I started working as a freelancer in the digital marketing field in 2014, and in 2016 I founded the Nomadismo Digital Portugal. In 2017 I moved to Palo Alto, in the heart of Silicon Valley, in California.

**How were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

In 2014, when I decided to work as a freelancer in digital marketing, I knew that I wanted to work with Portuguese projects and Portuguese entrepreneurs. After an internship in a communication agency in Lisbon, I fell in love with the motivation that Portuguese people share in the tech field. I was living and working in Paris, but I focus my freelance activity in Portugal. I started my business with some French and Internacional clients, but in a couple of months, I managed to have all my clients to be Portuguese. I'm very proud of this!

**Walk me through your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I work as a digital marketing freelancer, and all of my work is done 100% remotely. I specialized in content marketing strategy and SEO work, but I do all of the kind of work on digital marketing, like lead caption, writing, email marketing, websites, etc.  

But my focus right now is the Nomadismo Digital Portugal. I created this platform alone, but now, after a couple of successful launches, I have a team working with me. After a very successful crowdfunding campaign, we have +10k followers (email subscribers + social media) and consulting service.

This project is evolving. We want to be more than a simple content platform: me and my team we are working to amplify the Nomadismo Digital Portugal to something multi-content, with videos, e-courses, and masterminds. We want to promote the remote work as a healthy alternative to the traditional model of working in an office.

**How do you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the Portuguese tech industry?**

I lived six years in Paris, where I studied, traveled and discovered the entrepreneurship world. Now, I live in the heart of Silicon Valley, and I'm living the American Dream for someone in the tech and digital field. As a remote worker, I think I can play an essential role in the change of paradigm and mindset about the digital world.

**What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?
**

Work. Persist. Try. Fail. And work again. The tech and digital field are hard but magical. Everyone has a role and position to play, and the key to success is to accept that we don't know everything. We need to keep working and learning, every day. One thing that I learn it's that success comes when you share with others what you learn. Share your knowledge and ideas: don't have the fear that other people are going to steal your ideas or clients. You have something unique: yourself. So keep learning and adapting your knowledge, dreams and work to your project.

**Walk me through a day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**

Now I'm living in Silicon Valley, with a difference of 7-8 hours with Portugal. But the magical thing it's that 80% of my clients and contacts are Portuguese and from Portugal! I'm connected every day with my country. I mostly work at home or in a coworking space. Remote work is amazing because I can make my agenda and organize my time as I like.
