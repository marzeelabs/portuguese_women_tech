**How were you introduced
to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

I started working on tech in the early days of 1998 where everything was still to be discovered. AMS was one of my first customers. They were still big at the time and newly existing in Portugal. then came Cisco...

**Walk me through your work
and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

Dedicated to independent legal counseling on IT, technology, innovation and creativity industries at Techlawyers of which I am a co-founder. Our niche office delivers mainly contract solutions, M&A and IP/patent services on a global basis.

**What part of what you do,
you love the most?**

Enables me to work with different people and learn something new everyday.

**How do you think that your
background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

I profoundly know the industry and its ecosystem. To do Tech law you must know what you are talking about. There is no other possible way. On top of that, I have done business and lead tough negotiations in the four corners of the globe. Contract design and negotiation  is one of the things I do best and may be of considerable advantage to small tech companies in Portugal wanting to go international with the support of lawyers they trust.

**What advice do you have
for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Get the skills first ( hard and soft skills). Be curious and talk with loads of smart people. Make notes. Try and be courageous. If you fail, try again. Work, work, work. Learn. Always!

**Walk me through a day in
your life as a Portuguese woman in tech.**

I wake up early and help my kids to go to school. I help my youngest one backpacking everyday. When they leave, I urge to the gadget and read the news online. I share what I think is valuable to others. I walk to the office and start working on whatever issues I have. There may be days I have business design challenges, days I joint smart people trying to discover something at a lab or science hub, days I am mentoring and helping start-updating find their best way avoiding the pitfalls... calls, emails, hangouts, chat, presentations, proposals, checks and balances and... social media. Not as trendy as one could probably think.

**What's the best advice
you've ever received?**

Work hard for every customer: the big or the small and even if they cannot pay you the right money. Reputation does not have a price tag.

— 

**What apps/software/tools
can't you live without?**

I can live without apps and gadgets. :) However, I truly like Waze if I am driving in town. It really helps. I also use Cabify and Uber quite a few times per week and there's Linkedin, which I think is a great professional tool.

—

**Links that you want to share?**

Only the links to my LinkedIn page. Techlawyers' website is under construction. My work is mostly confidential I am afraid...

—

**Anything
else you want to share?**

Be happy. Try to remove your gadgets from the table when you are having a meal with a friend - Friends tend to last more than a season or two.
