## **Early years and where you came from?**

I was born in a small
village close to Porto and at 18 I went to the University of Porto to study
Management. Back then, I dreamt with a job at Goldman Sachs in New York, but
life changed dramatically and I ended up falling in love with startups.

**How were you
introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

I always knew I was
somehow geeky. I was always looking for new gadgets and in my teenage years, I
spent more hours than I like to admit playing PlayStation, GameBoy and
computer. My summer holidays and weekends were spent between books (I love to
read) and video games.

However, my real
introduction to tech happen when I was in college. In 2007, I joined FEP Junior
Consulting (student-led organization that does consultancy work) and I had my
first contact with incubators and startups. Then, through a series of lucky
moments, I ended up organizing Barcamp Porto in 2010 and that’s where I fell in
love with technology and entrepreneurship. Since then, everything I’ve done has
been driven by curiosity and a deep passion for connecting people and ideas.

**Walk me through your work and what
you are doing now in the tech industry.**

After 3 years,
promoting entrepreneurship in Portugal and abroad with Startup Pirates and
after a year working with startups (TOPDOX & Platforme) I’m now preparing
the launch of a couple of new projects. What I’m building is a consequence of
what I’ve done and learned since I joined college almost 10 years ago. It’s great to be back at the creation stage.

--

**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

I love connecting
people and ideas.

--

**How do you think that your background
and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the Portuguese tech
industry?**

Because of my non-technical
background, it’s easier for me to put aside the technicalities of building a
product and focus on the impact that product will have in the user’s life.

--

**What advice do you have for young women that want to
get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Start attending tech
meetups like Porto/Minho/Coimbra Startup Coffee, BREAK, Girls Lean in or
Portugal Girl Geek Dinners. Get actively involved by adding value to the other
participants and by helping out the organizers. After that, things will just
happen.

**Walk me through a day in your life as
a Portuguese women in tech.**

I wake up at 8:00am
full of energy. No matter at what time I went to sleep or how many hours of
sleep I had, I always wake up energized. Since I don’t have a “normal” job, I
work from home on most days. I try to read for an hour in the morning and then
start working at 10am. I always start by checking email, social networks and do
some easy tasks to get the day started. In the night before, I assign a few
hours to work on the projects I have at hands. I follow my plan until around
7pm or 8pm. Then dinner, some TV and one hour of reading. I try to have days
completely free of meetings. Those are always my most productive days.

**What's the best advice you've ever received?**

I honestly don’t
know. What I do know is that a lot of what I am was influenced by the examples
of my parents and grandmother. Since a young age, I was incentive to work hard,
stay curious and never give up.

--

**What apps/software/tools can't you live without?**

On a very practical
level I can’t live without Outlook for iPhone, Overcast and Messaging apps.
These 3 apps run my life. Outlook to connect with people and make sure I don’t
forget any appointments.  Overcast to listen to my podcasts. Messaging
apps (Whatsapp, Slack, Telegram and Messenger) to engage with people.

I really recommend a
google chrome extension called Strict Pomodoro. If you get distracted easily by
social networks this is a great way to ensure you don’t.
