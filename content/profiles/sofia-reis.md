**Early years and where you came from?**

I was born in Espinho, but after studying
in Porto this last one became the city I empathise the most, and I now live in
Porto with my husband and son. When I was little I wanted to be a fashion
designer, and throughout the years I have developed other interests through
experimentation and curiosity: design, creativity human development and behaviour,
spaces...

**How
were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

I’ve started in tech
doing Project Management for Mobile projects, since I was experienced in PM for
Architectural Projects (which is my academic background). I quickly moved into supporting
the management of a start up that grew from 5 people to 220 in 4 years. I fell
in love with human behaviour and connections, and the complex interactions in
the workplace.

**Walk me
through your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I am engaged in two projects that are
deeply important to me: Mindera – a start up in Porto downtown, running on
self-organisation with a flat structure – and LemonWorks – a startup engaged in
making work meaningful for everyone, through personal development,
organisational culture shifts, and office space as an important element on how
people feel and interact at work.

**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

Definitely generating new ideas and solutions
that bring people together, and help solve challenges through a cooperative and
community base thinking.

**How do
you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your
work in the Portuguese tech industry?**

My background has always been tied to
questioning everything and critically thinking about everything: are there new
and interesting ways to achieve a better outcome? 

Knowledge is something that I value, and I
keep learning as I go: with people around me, by sharing what I know, by
experimenting, reading and watching on the web what others are doing all over
the world.

**What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and
don’t know where to start?**

It’s difficult to answer this, because
each person has skills, knowledge and passion for things that could be
described as non-tech, but end up being incredibly useful in a tech world. I
believe we can use our skills/knowledge towards supporting a greater good or
purpose: we just need to find the people with whom we have that in common, and
give our best to be part of it. I would say, in order to find that group of
people, we need to engage in meeting new people: Meet Ups, events, workshops, Fairs
are all great places to find likeminded people, learn new things and find
interesting projects to be a part of.

**Walk me
through a day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**

I wake up relatively early and take an
hour to leave home to prep myself and my 7 year-old son. After driving him to
school I arrive to the office and try to read a few emails, but that doesn’t
always happen (I am not great at responding emails quickly), I talk to people
and have a few meetings to engage with people on different themes that matters
to them or myself. Most of my day is to investigate ideas and solutions for
various challenges, and to produce and communicate information in a way that
fits with how our brains work.

 

The end of the day I pick my son up from
school and my husband joins us to have a family meal cooked from scratch, and
spend some time together talking about what we loved most in our days and what
was most challenging as well.

**What's the best advice you've ever received?**

Always hold your values high in everything
you do.

**What apps/software/tools can't you live without?**

Pinterest has been with me for a few years
now, as I love visual information! I also love to see videos, and Ted Talks are
probably one of my favourite ways to learn about new ideas. What’s Up connects
me to people and Trello keeps ideas organized in a neat and collaborative way.
Google docs are just indispensable at the moment: you can pretty much do
anything with those.
