**Early years and where you came from?**

With a masters in computer science, I started as an intern working in the evolvement of a Quality Management System towards CMMI level 3 certification, and then gained some experience as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer.
As NDrive's Quality Assurance Manager, I managed a team for the first time, the NDrive QA team, focusing on Verifying and Validating Product Quality, and working on improving the software development process.
Since joining Blip, I have shifted from managing one specialilzed skills team of quality assurance engineers to a multidisciplinary team of delivery, encompassing software developers and quality assurance engineers, focusing on delivering high quality and high performant software to meet the business demands.
