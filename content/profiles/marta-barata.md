**Early years and where you came from?**

I have 27 years-old, born and raised in Lisbon.  I have always been a true communicator, passionate about nothing but everything. Coming from a Communications & Journalism background, where diaries and writing where part of my day, I fell in love for tech not a long time ago but surely is one of my biggest passions now.

**How were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

There isn't a specific moment. After moving to London I got to meet new realities and only by then I got in touch with tech and really understood how technology can truly change lives. 

The ability to develop something that helps people and that in, one way or another, changes societies and their mindsets is what it makes me love tech this much.

**Walk me through your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I am head of sales & ops at LeSalon - a London based company that combines tech and beauty in a seamless way by allowing customers to book beauty professionals to go to their preferable location at a time that is convenient to them whilst helping self employed professionals on building their clientele and work on their own terms.

**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

What I love the most is creating processes, brainstorming and wondering about how we can create something that brings value and meets our customers needs. 

I have joined the company as their very first employee, and despite all the challenges, witnessing our growth as a team and as a business is a big reward too.

–

**How do you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the Portuguese tech industry?**

I believe that living in a city like London for the past 3\+ years in combination with passion and natural motivation helped on me approaching technical/business problems in different perspectives. 

–

**What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

I don't think there is a right place to start. All you need is the will to learn, motivation and persistence. 

Make as many questions as you want and do not be afraid of showing your passion to everyone that crosses your path: people love to help and share their knowledge.

–

**Walk me through a day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**

I don't have the same day twice. Today I can be analyzing data, defining key metrics and creating processes and the next day I will be reaching out to potential new clients, managing recurring clients accounts or thinking of new communications & business development strategies. 

–

**What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?**

That I am enough and by the end of the day, I only have myself. Listen to people, learn with them but respect your institutions and beliefs.

–

**What apps/software/tools can’t you live without?**

Google drive, whatsapp, citymapper and a pen & paper! :)
