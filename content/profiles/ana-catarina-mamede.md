**Early years and where you
came from?**

Starting with my hometown where I was born, Peniche is a small city right close to the ocean, where I growth and study until my 17. After that, I went to the University of Beira Interior, in Covilhã, to study Biomedical Sciences. Then, when I finished my MSc, I dedicated myself to the study of molecular mechanism in oncology diseases, but also to the development of new anti-cancer drugs. In the mean time, during my PhD in Biomedicine, I discovered the interesting are of Science Communication.

**How were you introduced
to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

The introduction to the tech industry happened when I was a university student (or college student is the same thing), where in such multidisciplinary world of different areas of knowledge, I had the opportunity to be in contact with several companies, scientific and technological projects. However, my real first contact to the tech industry was when I decided to create my own company and contact the Óbidos Technology Park. From then on, the adventure began!

**Walk me through your work
and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

In Research Trial, a Science Communication Agency, my job is to support researchers, research teams and companies to communicate more and better. The objective is to enhance the public awareness about the science impact in society. Since I have a scientific background, it is much easier to perceive the message, sometimes complex, and transmits it in a simple, effective and error-free manner to several audiences.

**What part of what you do,
you love the most?**

Mixing science and communication is my passion. However, when it comes to broadcasting to special audiences, like seniors or children, I really love it. It is a challenge!

**How do you think that your
background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

My academic background is multidisciplinary and this has always helped me to blend concepts that were apparently unrelated, like Science and Communication. My background and knowledge taught me to solve problems, to be self-taught and, above all, to be very curious.

**What advice do you have
for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Always be very curious and proactive: speak with other entrepreneurs, give value to contacts and experiences. Whether it's an event, in a dedicated program or in a visit to a business/start up incubator, there's plenty to learn.

**Walk me through a day in
your life as a Portuguese woman in tech.**

A day in my life can vary a lot since I don’t have a “normal” job. Normally, I start my day at 8am checking the e-mails and social networks. During the day there is always a huge variety of content to produce and manage for different types of clients and projects. Since I work from home on most days, my schedule is flexible and I can easily adjust it to the projects and tasks in which I am involved.

**What's the best advice
you've ever received?**

 My parents always encouraged me to be a hard worker and not give up. I always remember their example and I have tried to guide my personal and professional life according to what they taught me.

**What apps/software/tools
can't you live without?**

Since I am responsible for the management of social networks of several clients, obviously I do not pass without Facebook, Twitter, Linked, etc. Besides, Outlook, ResearchGate, Mendely and Hootsuite are very importante too!
