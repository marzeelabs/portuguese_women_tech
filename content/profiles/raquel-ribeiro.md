**Early years and where you came
from?**

I
have wanted to be a scientist for as far back as I can remember, even before I
started primary school. I wanted to learn and understand how the things around
me worked. My parents always encouraged me to follow my thirst for knowledge,
and I embarked on a Physics degree at the University of Porto. But it was not
enough to understand physics – I wanted to learn more and from the best. 

That’s
when I traveled to Cambridge in England. I earned a Masters in Advanced Mathematics
and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics, focusing on models of the early universe.
After that, I put my brave hat on and traveled to the U.S. to pursue
postdoctoral work in the area of dark energy. I then returned to England for
another postdoctoral appointment in London. 

After
learning a lot about the universe, I felt I was not challenging myself enough,
so I decided to redirect my background with a new focus on data science. I may
not be solving the wave function of the universe now, but I am certainly
improving people’s lives by using mathematical models to interpret data.

**How were you introduced to the
world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

Having
lived abroad for nearly 10 years, I missed home dearly. I wanted to come back
and put my skills to work in the country that had entrusted me with a Ph.D.
fellowship through FCT. I was already working as a data scientist in London
when I learned about a startup in Portugal, called Feedzai. Working as a data
scientist in an anti-fraud company had all the key points that I was looking
for in a job. It combined mathematics and data science to fight fraud. So not
only does it affect almost everyone in the global world we live on nowadays,
but it is also related to finance, an area I am interested in. 

In
addition to this, I was noticing many articles published in international news
sites and magazines about Lisbon becoming the tech city in Europe. My attention
was captured, and after being approached by the HR team, I had to explore the
possibility of coming back to Portugal and joining the Tuga tech scene! And I
am really glad I did!

**Walk me through your work and what
you are doing now in the tech industry.**

Fighting
fraud is second to none. Fraudsters are smart and always find innovative ways
of deceiving the rules in place to protect customers. To fight them, we need
algorithms that learn constantly, and that can adapt to different patterns and
trends as soon as they arise. At Feedzai, we use Machine Learning to detect and
prevent fraud. Our group achieves this by feeding data to an algorithm which
automatically learns the patterns therein to understand what leads to fraud and
how we can prevent it.

**What part of what you do, you love
the most?**

Whichever
work I do, I love brainstorming and writing on boards. Some of my best work
starts on whiteboards, drawing functions and understanding equations. Another
aspect that I like about my work is how engaging it is. Data is incredibly rich
and can have the most intricate patterns, so it is really exciting when you
find something unexpected in data.

**How do you think that your
background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

Being
successful in the tech industry requires a selection of skills that combine
natural motivation, background academic knowledge and hard work. I believe the
technical skills I have acquired in Math and Physics allow me to approach every
problem with an inquisitive mind, and to seek mathematical explanations for the
behaviour in data. My experience abroad on the other hand gives me a different
perspective on a technical/business problem.

**What advice do you have for young
women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

All
you need is motivation and curiosity. Learn as much as you can about tech, not
just the technical details but also the business aspects. That combination can
give you the edge and a great passion for your subject in return. Don’t ever
feel content with what you learn. Rather, strive to learn from different
sources. Nowadays, there is a vast array of online learning platforms which
teach you virtually everything.

**Walk me through a day in your life
as a Portuguese women in tech.**

I
enjoy cycling to work, and I am fortunate enough that Feedzai’s penthouse
office offers a spectacular view over Parque das Nacoes. My day is usually
filled with data wrangling and monitoring, figuring out how to improve our
deployed models, and discussing ideas with my colleagues. Many people reach out
to me to get advice on how to become a data scientist, so I try to be active on
Twitter for outreach purposes.

**What's the best advice you've ever
received?**

Do
what you love and learn to do it well. It only counts when you give it your
best.

**What apps/software/tools can't you
live without?**

Jupyter
notebooks and Rstudio. Having said that, I find that the notebooks where I can
write down my scribblings can’t be replaced with any software. On a personal
level, like everybody else, I have to control the urge of checking Instagram
every other hour.

**Links that you want to share? In
what are you working on…**

Head
over to feedzai.com to learn more about the work that I do with the fabulous
anti-fraud ninjas in the team.

**Anything else you want to share?**

I’m
incredibly happy to be back home, and I can’t wait to see the tech industry
booming with more great ideas!
