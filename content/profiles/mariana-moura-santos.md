Early years and where you came from?

I started in Berlin at Universal Music where I worked as motion graphic designer producing animation for tv.

Did a Master in Digital Media in Stockholm at Hyper Island.

In 2010 started at the Guardian Newspaper in London, where I worked as an interactive designer in the development team.

After witnessing the lack of women in technology, I started Chicas Poderosas in Latin America, an organization that brings access to digital media talent to women working in communication.

How do you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the Portuguese tech industry?

I am right now starting in the Portuguese industry, so still a bit early to tell, but what I know I do bring to the table is a capacity of moving and engaging community, make shit happen and move minds forward working in each individual full potential.

What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?

Go and throw yourself on it, learn from doing, fail fast and don't avoid failure. Embrace failing as your best friend. Put yourself out of your comfort zone and stay with the problem. Eventually you'll find your way around, but you need to be there to learn how it works. Have a cohort!!!!

Walk me through a day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.

Right now my everyday is focused on studying ruby at the Le Wagon bootcamp. As an amazing organization that creates developers in 9 weeks, I want to test it myself and see how can we work together to make it scale. At night I work on managing communities in Latin America.
