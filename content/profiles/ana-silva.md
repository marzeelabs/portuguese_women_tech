**Early
years and where you came from?**

Although I have a training background in
management, technology was always an important enabler of the work I was doing.
My early work was in competitive intelligence (tracking the competitive context
– competition and market – of the manufacturing sector I was working on) which
meant designing the requirements and structure of knowledge management tools.
From there, information management, collaboration and digital technology was
always a great part of my work.

**How
were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

When I was about 9 years old one of my
favourite toys was [Spelling B from Texas Instruments](https://www.amazon.com/Original-SPELLING-Learning-Texas-Instruments/dp/B00ANSVZJE). It looked like a big orange calculator but it was a sort of
mini-computer to help learn English. I sometimes wonder how much that
influenced me J Later, a pivotal moment
for me was signing up to a post degree in Information Management &
Marketing Intelligence back in 2008: that’s where my need to understand the role
of tech in businesses and societies started to get really serious.

**Walk me
through your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I’m managing the Open
Innovation initiatives at Sonae, a retail group based in Portugal. The role
implies scouting the best innovation partners in academia & research, the
startups ecosystem and others and engaging them to work with us in
co-innovation projects. That also means keeping up with technology trends and
developments that influence how we address innovation challenges. Digital and
other technologies have a great impact in retail innovation!

**What
part of what you do, you love the most?**

My role is essentially about discovering
competencies and common interested between different parties and building
relationships (I’m sort of an innovation partnerships matchmaker). I LOVE the
opportunity to build bridges between different organizations and help
coordinate the efforts needed to make our co-innovation projects work.
Combining different expertise to address real challenges is the best!

**How do
you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your
work in the Portuguese tech industry?**

Hmm, great question! I would highlight a
personal characteristic and a professional one. I am very curious and love
learning and I see intellectual curiosity as a key skill in tech and
innovation. Regarding my professional path, having started my career in
competitive intelligence made me appreciate the importance of seeing the big
picture before delving into the smaller details. So today I still try to look
for the big picture, and the connections and interdependence between different
elements, when addressing a challenge.

**What
advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know
where to start?**

I remember wondering,
many years ago, if I was a woman in tech because I don’t have an IT or similar
background. But I learned from tech friends, and from the great people at cool
meetups that you should look at technology from a broad lens. So my advice
would be: get out there – go to conferences, attend meetups, join hackathons,
tinker and experiment and listen and learn. Do not let your background or
current job limit you. Groups like [Geek Girls Portugal](http://www.geekgirlsportugal.pt/) (formerly Portugal Girl
Geek Dinners) and many others are a good place to start. Meetups like the [Porto Startup Coffee](https://www.meetup.com/PortoStartupCoffee/) are great experiences. Also,
don’t be afraid to reach out to people in tech (male or female) that inspire
you and ask them how they started. And, of course, check [Portuguese Women in Tech](http://pwit-cms.netlify.com/) J

**Walk me
through a day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**

It depends if I’m
travelling or not. It can either be a regular day at the office (with meetings,
coffee and the struggle to focus in an open space J ) or crazy long days
with early flights when travelling abroad to meet our cool innovation partners.

**What's
the best advice you've ever received?**

Never stop learning and
stimulating your curiosity. Never, Ever! And always try to balance work with
other activities: they will make you grow (personally and professionally).

--

**What
apps/software/tools can't you live without?**

Favourite tools? Strangely enough… paper notebooks J I may not remember where
I saved that file but I always remember something I noted using pen and paper. Appear.in
has been saving me from skype issues lately so kudos to them for making online
conferencing really smooth. And, of course, my favourite serendipity machine:
Twitter! It’s where I find the most interesting content and people.

**Links that you want to
share?** 

Not some
I’ve been working on but something I’ve been thinking about: we need deeper
discussions about the impact of AI, robots and the like. I’ve blogged about it [here](https://artlifework.wordpress.com/2016/12/11/demons-and-design-a-tale-of-new-tech/) and would love to
hear what other people think.

**Anything else you want to share?**

My motto:
your work (job) may not be your life but let your life ignite your work!
