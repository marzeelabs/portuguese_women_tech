**Early years and where you
came from?**

After a Communications Degree I started working for Daimler Chrysler in the Internal Communication Department. After a few years I changed jobs to make the rebranding of a Telco company KPNQwest. It was once more a multinational environment, but this time the telco dynamics were completely different from the Car/Train industry. I continued working in Sonae companies always related to Telco or IT, and that is where I spent 10 years before coming to NOS.  NOS is a huge challenge, specifically to people like me that work and are setting up new B2B lines of communication.

**How were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese
tech industry?**

I was introduced when I started working for KPNQwest, formerly known as EUnet. And where IT people that established the Internet in Portugal were working.

**Walk me through your work
and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I work as Communication and Business Support Lead at the Marketing Empresas Team. The job allows me to work with different marketing segments, go to marketing approaches, and be in the forefront of new offer launches and new product development launches. In the B2B telecommunications market an open mind, initiative and being open to continuous change are important. It is this dynamic that creates new opportunities and challenges you as a marketing and communication professional continuously.

**What part of what you do,
you love the most?**

The creative process of creating a new identity to a product/solution. The brainstorming between IT and Telco people and Marketing and Communication professionals. And see the final outputs in stores, advertising, sales teams.

**How do you think that your
background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

Having worked for both national and  multinationals in industry, Telco and IT environments, that organization, project management and process orientation to achieve goals is key.

**What advice do you have
for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Nowadays all the information is available. It is a question of looking. Universities have programs that invite students to know the tech environment. The new startup environment has multiple stakeholders that organize events to present projects and ask for a broader discussion on objectives.  the Business environment open its doors through events, prizes, and hackathons. NOS for instances organizes with Fábrica de Startups and Beta.i continuous innovation and tech activities.

**Walk me through a day in
your life as a Portuguese woman in tech.**

First of all I need to ready my daily emails. Afterwards see the meetings or events of the day, and set up a routine of monitoring what is done, is being developed, and define a time schedule to have agencies deliver materials and activities.

As my job is very dynamic my days are never the same.  It can be the development of a briefing to launch a new product. Speaking to the agency to launch no web campaigns. An event to generate leads. Meeting with IT or Telco partners, ....What is important daily is to define our goals and achieving them. And to deliver the best performance.

**What's the best advice
you've ever received?**

You have to be open to learn every minute of the day. The world is changing at a never known velocity. It is important to dedicated a few minutes of the day to new companies, new trends, new technologies.
