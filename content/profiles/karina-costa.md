**Early years and where you
came from?**

I was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. My early years of entrepreneurship/tech were a bunch of hacking around different hardware prototypes… a mess that got me started!

**How were you introduced
to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

I lived most of my life in Lisbon, Portugal. At 22 I started a company that I later took to the first Startup Weekend in Portugal. I ended up winning the 1st prize and that remarkable experience made me want to explore and later support the tech community that was starting to grow.

**Walk me through your work
and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

Techstars invests in high potential early stage tech startups. My job is to find, invest and work with the most talented tech entrepreneurs through the course of our accelerator program and beyond.

—

**What part of what you do,
you love the most?**

Get to work and help very talented people with all sorts of backgrounds.

—

**How do you think that your
background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

Since I joined Techstars we got the first 3 Portuguese startups into different accelerator programs, the most direct way I believe I can help the community is by finding Portuguese promising companies that want to join Techstars. 

Generally as I'm based in Boulder, Colorado but with a strong network across the US I can help Portuguese companies that want to join the US market.

**What advice do you have
for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Be thoughtful on why you do what you do. Know that there are no boundaries but also no excuses to succeeding. Embrace your inner troublemaker.

—

**What's the best advice
you've ever received?**

Success does not come to those who are better but to those who don't give up.

— 

**What apps/software/tools
can't you live without?**

Slack :)
