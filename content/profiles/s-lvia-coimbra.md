**Early years and where you
came from?**

Technology has not always been a part of my life. I grew up between a combination of two weird-related interests: maths and dancing. As no path seemed too obvious, I decided to study management to keep all the endless possibilities open (or maybe I was just too confused to choose). 

The good thing about being too confused to choose is that your infinite curiosity may take you everywhere.

**How were you introduced
to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

It was more of a process that a specific moment. Studying in Porto, Paris and Barcelona was an eye-opening experience as I got the chance to work and learn in very innovative and collaborative environments. My interest in new business models and tech companies continue to grow as I got more involved in the ecosystem by volunteering and participating in several events and workshops.

**Walk me through your work
and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I’m currently working at Farfetch as a Product Owner in the Black & White business unit - a full-service agency, selling multichannel e-commerce solutions for luxury fashion brands, based on the Farfetch core systems and services. It is a very exciting time to be part of a revolutionary e-commerce company at the cutting edge of fashion and technology.

Apart from that and as a strong advocate of gender equality and children's education, I develop some side projects that use technology as an enabler for social change.

**What part of what you do,
you love the most?**

Product is what I love the most and I find motivation in the full spectrum of product development: from wandering around new trends and discussing the unpredictable future, to understanding customer needs, and finally making ideas come to life.

**How do you think that your
background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

When working in the tech industry, you always need a fine balance between business and tech; done and perfect; chaos and structure; laughing and crying; learning and teaching; (customer) needs and dreams.

My background allows me to navigate both extremes with ease, always with 3 principles in mind: know your customers/audience, understand the why behind everything and turn (not keep) it simple.

**What advice do you have
for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Look for people and companies that inspire you. Understand why you care. And don’t be afraid to reach out to people - you will be immensely surprised how everyone is willing to help.

**Walk me through a day in
your life as a Portuguese woman in tech.**

I would love to have a very clear routine to share - but to be honest my day can be all over the place. Sometimes I run [at 6am](http://airmail.calendar/2017-04-10%2006:00:00%20WEST), others [at 9pm](http://airmail.calendar/2017-04-10%2021:00:00%20WEST). Throughout the days I may be running between meetings, solving problems with my team or preparing product showcases. I may leave the office [at 6pm](http://airmail.calendar/2017-04-10%2018:00:00%20WEST) or [9pm](http://airmail.calendar/2017-04-10%2021:00:00%20WEST), depending if I’m feeling productive. And after work I may go to an event, having dinner with friends, work on side projects or just die on the sofa.

**What's the best advice
you've ever received?**

Forget your weaknesses. Play to your strengths and interests.

”Another thing that I have found is that intense interest in any subject is indispensable if you’re really going to excel in it. I could force myself to be fairly good in a lot of things, but I couldn’t excel in anything in which I didn’t have an intense interest.”
- Charlie Munger

**What apps/software/tools
can't you live without?**

WhatsApp, Instagram, slack, google docs, outlook and white pieces of paper.
