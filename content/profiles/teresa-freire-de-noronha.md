**Early years and where you
came from?**

I was born in Lisbon, until 5 in Arganil, near Coimbra where I learn to love nature and to be closed to everyone. Then grew up in Odivelas, and from that time I remember the people and to make a lot of questions, wish I like to do until now.

—

**How were you introduced
to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

I went to study System Engineering and than I went to the consultancy world.

—

**Walk me through your work
and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I always like to know the best practices and always saw technology in the consumer optic. I like to understand the need, create the solutions and design the functionalities. So, I specialized as a Business Analyst and have participated in many interesting projects as a Project Manager or Business Analyst, like the Portuguese Citizen Card. 

Then I noticed that something big was happening in the mobile world, and I decided to share my analysis of Apps in a blog, I create: Apps para que te quero. But then the questions begin to come up in my head and I step into Startup world. With the participation at Web Summit and after trying to explain what my blog was about, it turn into StartApps.

**What part of what you do,
you love the most?**

I love to understand the needs as I love to know the tech solutions that are blossom every day, and traduce them into common people language.

— 

**How do you think that your
background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

I think that understand technology and being use to it, turns easier to speak and write about it in a common way.

**What advice do you have
for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

My advice is to understand what you really like and why... And do it!

**Walk me through a day in
your life as a Portuguese woman in tech.**

I woke up, I ate my breakfast with my family, I leave my child by foot at her kindergarten, then I go to the office and help in the Application Maintenance Management for Business at a big energy company. At lunch time I go to do some interview to the blog, or use it to know some App, or just go for lunch with the office girl and friends. At the end of the day I go home, meet my family or I go to an event, meet up or training. In my day to day life, I just walk don't need car or bus. Sometimes I use Uber or my favorite, Cabify.

—

**What's the best advice
you've ever received?**
