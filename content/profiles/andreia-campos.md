**Early years and where you came from? **

I was born in Porto. With
a degree in Management from FEP, I started working in finance for Siemens, a
German company. I moved to Beijing in 2008 to study Mandarin and start working
in the fashion industry. After Inov Contact program in Mexico City, I moved
back to Porto to work for Parfois as Marketing Manager where I stayed for 4
years

**Walk me
through your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

Start my day looking at
metrics, then move to testing out new features.  Whenever I can I also like to help the
curation team with editorials.

**How do
you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your
work in the Portuguese tech industry?**

With a business degree I feel more
confident with some decisions I have to make – however I always think that a
Tech background would help a lot more in my work. Fortunately I’ve hired the
best people to complement the areas where I have less experience.
