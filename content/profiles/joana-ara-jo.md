**Walk me through a day in
your life as a Portuguese woman in tech.**

I wake up with difficult, my alarm starts at 7h20 to get up at 8h. I am not a morning person, definitely.
I check my phone to see messages, emails, skype, facebook... I take a shower, prepare breakfast, etc... I start working at 9h30. I start looking at the dashboard and see what is missing to check. 
I meet with development team if it's needed and start testing some software bugs or issues.
At the end of the day (17h30) I start my meetings with my team in USA. I update them with my daily work. They will send me their work update in my next morning :)
