**Early
years and where you came from?**

My name is Catarina, I’m from Rebordosa, a small town near Porto, Portugal. I’m 27 years old and I’m a Web Developer. I’m also Co-Founder of the Girls Lean In - a community that encourages women to grow in their diverse workforce fields and to achieve leadership roles. Recently I joined to a Toastmaster club - a great place to improve public speaking and develop leadership skills. In Braga I'm Ambassador of Geek Girls Portugal - a community for women that love technology.

**How
were you introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

I was introduced to the world of
technology when I was at elementary School. I remember that I was fascinated
with computers when I saw them for the first time. I always tried to look and
understand how they worked and what we could do with them. I also enjoy maths
and at high school, I realized that programming was similar to math terms. Then,
I chose to study computer engineering at university and also pursue a career
connected to technology.

C#.

**What
part of what you do, you love the most?**

The part that I like most is when I’m
looking for the solutions to solve my problem. To do that, I have to analyse
the requests and generate solutions. When I realize that I have the ability to
decide how the problem is going to be solved and I can see that my solution is
functional, correct and works well, I feel amazingly great.

**How do
you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your
work in the Portuguese tech industry?**

It is very important to know if we are
able to work in specific areas of knowledge. In the world of programming it is
extremely important to know the programming paradigms and the main languages to
solve challenges. For this, it is important to know and study more deeply the
different programming languages that will give you ability to adapt to the market
needs.

**What
advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know
where to start?**

I think above all if you
like challenges and know that any day of your life won´t be the same as the
previous day, the world of technology is the most suitable. There will always
be problems for you to solve, get out of your comfort zone and realize that you
still have much to discover in the world of technology. Every day there are new
inventions, new technologies that make you learn and adapt to the unexpected.
In my opinion, this is absolutely fantastic and makes me believe more and more
that working with computer technology is what I want to do for my whole life.

**Walk me
through a day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**

Nowadys, I’m living in
Figueira da Foz, one city with sea and river that has an impressive beauty. I
like to get up early, take my breakfast and realize that is another fantastic
day full of challenges. I like to get early to the office. Punctuality is a
quality that I admire and I hope to never lose. I plan my day according to the
goals I need to do and achieve in a specific time. The 9 hours day-work are
always challenging and I don’t feel the time going by. Watching the sea and
reading is also a part of my day. Usually, my day ends with the gym workout. I
also like to eat well and healthy.

the best advice you've ever received?**

To appreciate the little
and simple things in life. Not only, it is important to work and live a life full
of goals but also, to see that all your effort has a positive return. It is
also important to listen, to understand what surrounds you and help those in
need, by knowing that what you do has an impact on something.
