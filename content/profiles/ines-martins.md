**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

How fun and simple it is. You have a problem to solve and you try to solve it just like a puzzle. There's nothing complicated about it, other than the problem itself.

**What advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Once I decided I wanted to switch careers I started working for a company where I did some communication work and received software/programming training in return. There are many companies that offer Academies and training programs, as a way to recruit "non-techies" to the field, so I think the entry barrier is very low, it's just a matter of knowing that there's a place for women.
