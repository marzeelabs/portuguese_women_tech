**Early
years and where you came from?**

I was born in a beautiful city called
Leiria, 100km north of Lisbon. As a kid I was mostly into arts, doing theatre,
writing, drawing and studying to become a musician. When I turned 17 I moved to
Lisbon, still not sure if I wanted to be a full time piano player or something
else. I enrolled in 2 higher education schools: Music and Economics, two very
different fields but both very interesting to me. Very soon I realized that the
discipline it took to play piano for 7 hours a day, if I was to be any good,
was too heavy for me. I made a choice and 4 years later I majored in Economics
and became a business journalist. I’m still passionate about music, though.

**Walk me
through your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I currently work at the
Ministry of Economy as an advisor to the Secretary of State of Industry, João
Vasconcelos. I followed João here because I believe he is the most qualified
person in the country to design a public policy to support entrepreneurs. Most
of my job is to help him implement a national strategy for entrepreneurship,
called Startup Portugal. I have always been passionate about this. Working as a
journalist 15 years ago, I was very much interested in telling the stories of
people who did it their way. Then after working as a journalist for 6 years, I
spent 7 years working for consulting businesses in large multinationals, until
eventually the corporate culture drove me away. I learned a lot there, but it
just wasn’t me. So 5 years ago I quit my very well-paid job and decided to
start my own consultancy boutique, called Too Small To Fail, which specialized
in supporting a new generation of entrepreneurs that were starting to change my
country. That’s when I came across João Vasconcelos. João was just launching a
place called Startup Lisboa, which became the most relevant business incubator
in the country. That’s where my firm was headquartered. Watching him build that
place was enough to see him for the leader he is.

**What
part of what you do, you love the most?**

I have this romantic idea that the public
policies that are being implemented right now under João’s mandate are changing
the life of several people for the better. Being a part of that makes me feel
very honoured and privileged… and surprised too. I always believed that you
changed the world in the private sector. This newfound love for the public
service is something very humbling and thrilling at the same time, for me.

**How do
you think that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your
work in the Portuguese tech industry?**

I was trained as an economist, which helps
if you’re working in the Ministry of Economy. But I believe that 75% of your
performance depends not so much on technical skills but on behavioural skills.
If I had to choose one thing that I believe has more impact on my performance
today, I would say that having worked on so many different jobs, corporate
cultures and under such different leaderships allowed me to develop an
adaptability that is crucial to relating to so many different stakeholders
nowadays. Entrepreneurs and engineers are a demanding crowd and being able to
communicate with them is challenging in many ways.

**What
advice do you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know
where to start?**

As in any other field,
creating a network is key. Visit the communities (incubators, accelerators,
etc.), talk to the people, ask for advice, read about who’s who. And don’t be
afraid to make mistakes.

--

**Walk me
through a day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**

I spend about 50% of my
time writing and communicating what the Portuguese Government is doing with
programs such as Startup Portugal and Industry 4.0, so that people learn about
the opportunities that are being created to support their businesses. The rest
of my time I manage projects and I assist the Secretary of State of Industry in
his very dynamic agenda. Never a dull moment!

**What's
the best advice you've ever received?**

When I started my career
as a journalist, my editor advised to always sleep on difficult resolutions.
Having a very impatient and impulsive personality, this proved to be some of
the best advice I could have received. Nowadays I’m trying to incorporate another
great piece of advice: done it’s better than perfect.

**What
apps/software/tools can't you live without?**

I’m an all-apple lover. I have 4 apple devices in my life. I’m also
highly addicted to Spotify and Songkick.
