**Early years and
where you came from?**

I’m from Figueira
da Foz, a small city near the sea in the center of Portugal, where I was born
and raised. I moved to Lisbon in 2003 to study Science of Communication. I
lived for 6 months in Pisa, Italy, in 2007, under the Erasmus program and then
returned to Lisbon, the city that is also my home.

**How were you
introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

I started writing
about entrepreneurship and tech startups in 2010, when the Lisbon startup scene
begun emerging. The stories of the people that are now crossing seas and
helping to put our country in the international startup radar started back
then. I saw the rising of some of our first associations, incubators and most
well known entrepreneurs. And my passion for the subject grew as the startup
scene was also growing.

**Walk me through
your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

I’m a journalist
in Observador, an online media that is also a startup. We were born in 2014 and
we are currently testing our business model - we support our business only
through ads (and we are testing different ways to do it). We have no paper
associated or a paid subscription. All our articles are free. I’ve been
specializing my career in subjects that are important for the digital economy -
startups, digital revolution, venture capitalism, businesses based in tech
innovation. I sign a weekly newsletter on these subjects.

**What part of what
you do, you love the most?**

To be able to
tell the stories of the people that may be redefining our economy, although we
will only be aware of that it in the future. Writing about the changes that the
digital revolution is making not only in the economy, but in almost every
single aspect of our daily life - the way we communicate, we work, we see things,
we date, we choose our lifestyle, we manage our time -  is writing while the world is also
discovering how to deal with all of that. At the same time. It’s risky, but
it’s overwhelming. My job is to explain what is happening now, but also what is
still yet to come - what are the benefits and the fears of this digital
revolution.

**How do you think
that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

My will to
understand more what is happening in the digital economy, with the eyes of a
non-tech person, is crucial to explain to all kinds of people (tech lovers or
not) the insights, benefits, problems and fears of the tech world.

**What advice do
you have for young women that want to get into tech and don’t know where to
start?**

Choose a thing
you like to do or that you are interested in, no matter what it is, because
once you’ll find out that, you will also find the tech way to do it. Nowadays
everything that surrounds us can be based in tech. We are all living under
digital patterns. Everything is tech. You just have to figure it out what is
yours.
