**Early years and where you came from?**

I was born in Coimbra but I always
lived in Rio Maior, where almost my father’s family lives. I don’t remember
being the only child because my first sister was born when I was 13 months old.
I always studied in public schools: first in Rio Maior and then, at the
university, in Lisbon and Madrid. I started working as a journalist in 2007
and, in 2009, I integrate the founders team of i newspaper. I’ve been invited
for launching Dinheiro Vivo project and I founded fazedores movement, in that
website. On september 2016, I joined the founders team of ECO, as an editor to
innovation, startups and entrepreneurs issues. Meanwhile I lived and worked in
Buenos AIres, and in New York.

**How were you
introduced to the world of the Portuguese tech industry?**

Almost every startup story has a
tech story. So, I’ve been introduced and realized that tech can be the secret
for almost every business nowadays by doing interviews, talking to people and
knowing #fazedores (makers, people who do things). Then, when I was in Buenos
Aires, I met Mariana Santos who is the founder of Chicas Poderosas project,
which has the goal to improve tech skills in girls to empower them at
newsrooms. At that time, I started to learn how to code, not for being a
developer but to know how to talk to them. Good work is always a question of
empathy, I guess.

**Walk me through
your work and what you are doing now in the tech industry.**

In september 2016 I’ve been
invited to join ECO’s newsroom, a new media website that we launched on
october. My idea to the issues I manage there is to give voice to entrepreneurs
and make their stories to be tilled and meaningful. They are so inspiring
people that they deserve to be known.

**What part of what you do, you love the most?**

Being outside, talking to people.
The privilege to know new people every day and telling their stories. To watch
their projects growing. To watch them starting new projects.

--

**How do you think
that your background and knowledge impact the way you approach your work in the
Portuguese tech industry?**

There are two things that I
believe are the most valuable characteristics to do what I do: empathy and
curiosity.  Empathy to talk to people and
absorb their best and most inspiring stories. And curiosity to ask everything I
want to know and then tell the story. The rest is a bit of lucky.

**What advice do you have for young women that want to
get into tech and don’t know where to start?**

Don’t think too much and just
start. Read, talk to people, exercise, try and fail a lot. Fail fast for
succeed soon.

**Walk me through a
day in your life as a Portuguese women in tech.**

I am lucky, I know, but I never
have the same day twice. We work on shifts, so depending on the week, a I go to
the gym in the morning or evening. I wake up early, read the big national and
international news while I eat my breakfast at home. Pick the metro and the
bus, take a lot of pictures on my way to work and share the best one on
Instagram. Work long hours, always talking to different people, inside and outside
ECO. Lunch at work, busy all day, go home or cinema, talks or conferences. Cook
dinner, have dinner, read a little. Sometimes some TV series, movies or just
bed. :)

**What's the best advice you've ever received?**

Don’t take yourself too serious.
Do your best, always.

--

**What apps/software/tools can't you live without?**

Whatsapp for everything,
citymapper and Google Maps to choose the right and easiest way to go. Instagram
to inspire.
